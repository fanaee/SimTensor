About SimTensor
-----------------

SimTensor software has been developed at the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence in INESC TEC research institute in the context of European FP7 Project "MAESTRA". The goal of SimTensor project is to provide a multi-platform, open-source software for generating artificial tensor-structured data (CP/PARAFAC and Tucker) for reproducible research on tensor factorization algorithms. SimTensor is a stand-alone application based on MATALB (You do not need a MATLAB license to run it). It provides a wide range of facilities for generating tensor data with various configurations. SimTensor comes with a user-friendly graphical user interface, which enables the user to generate tensors with complicated settings in an extremely easy and fast way. It also has this facility to export generated data to universal formats such as CSV and HDF5, which can be imported via a wide range of programming languages (C, C++, Java, R, Fortran, MATLAB, Perl, Python, and many more). The most innovative part of SimTensor is that you can generate temporal tensors with periodic waves, seasonal effects and streaming structure. You also can apply constraints such as non-negativity and different kinds of sparsity to your data. SimTensor also gives you the option to simulate different kinds of change-points and inject various types of anomalies in your data.
